  Guidelines to enforce proper TDD using bun test as the test runner.
  These rules cover testing React components and hooks, and stress writing high quality tests and assertions.

rules:
  - Always use 'bun test' as the test runner for consistency and speed.
  - Adopt a TDD approach: write tests before the implementation.
  - For React component tests:
      - Use render and snapshot testing to capture UI consistency.
      - Test component behavior and interactions using testing libraries like React Testing Library.
  - For hooks tests:
      - Test hook behavior, including state changes and side-effects.
      - Use utilities such as 'react-hooks-testing-library' for isolation.
  - Write high quality tests:
      - Ensure assertions are clear, specific, and expressive.
      - Use descriptive test case names and structure tests for readability.
      - Keep tests isolated, fast, and reliable.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions for test files (e.g., *.spec.ts, *.test.tsx).
  - Maintain test coverage and update tests as code evolves.
