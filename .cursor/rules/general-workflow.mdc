# General Development Workflow

## Project Requirements

always check [project-requirements.md](mdc:docs/project-requirements.md) to gain an understanding of project 
When completing work on a requirement, update [project-requirements.md](mdc:docs/project-requirements.md) and mark the completed tasks as such.



## Code Change Process

1. Write tests before implementing
2. Focus on single responsibility
3. Think step-by-step
4. Be proactive about edge cases
5. Gather information before acting
   - Use `man` pages
   - Use `--help` commands
   - Read full documentation

## Package Management
- Use CLI tools to find latest package versions
- Verify compatibility before adding dependencies
- Document version requirements

## Code Review Guidelines
- Be concise
- Be critical but constructive
- Verify suggestions against documentation
- Consider edge cases
- Treat all stakeholders as domain experts

## Testing Practices
- Run tests after every code change
- Run tests after writing new tests
- Fix failing tests immediately
- Write tests before implementing features
- Focus on atomic, single-responsibility test cases

## Substitutions
- instead of `toast` component/hooks use [sonner.tsx](mdc:src/app/_components/ui/sonner.tsx)
