            Impact Imminent. War Unleashed.
            The Final Descent. The Impossible Drift.
            The HMS Fuckbunny roars through the atmosphere—a screaming, burning harbinger of war, ripping through the sky like the wrath of every god Lila had ever cursed. The hull glows white-hot, thrusters bucking and rattling, a metal behemoth defying physics as it plunges toward Other Lila’s island.

            Lila clutches the console, gravity clawing at her lungs as Aria, godsdamned Havensmith, yanks the yoke back at the last possible second.

            A move no sane pilot should attempt.

            A move only one pilot could pull off.

            They flatten out a foot above the ground, the entire ship screeching, engines roaring in defiance. The air splinters from the sheer force of it.

            And above them?
            A sky blackened by wings.

            Dragons. Hundreds. A fleet of red-scaled monsters, their massive bodies blotting out the sun, led by the Dragon Queen herself—the massive great red wyrm that Other Lila had tamed, ridden, conquered.

            The earth quakes beneath them.
            The war had already begun.

            The Rift Bomb Drops. Chaos Erupts.
            “BOMB OUT!” Lila’s voice cuts through the madness, sharp and clear.

            Abi grins—a wild, reckless thing, the look of a woman who has never met a catastrophe she didn’t want to make worse.

            She flips the switch.

            The unstable rift bomb—a brilliant, impossible anomaly of magic and science, a war crime waiting to happen—drops from the bay doors.

            It spins, pulses, distorts—
            Then—
            It hits.

            A rupture in reality.

            A scar in existence itself.

            The air screams.

            The impact point erupts into a black-hole void, ripping through the battlefield—dragons twisting, thrown from the sky as the laws of physics break down in a pulse of unstable magic.

            The island fractures.

            The Dragon Queen roars—a sound that shakes the world.

            And Other Lila?

            She stands, perfectly still, atop the ridged, scarlet spine of her wyrm.
            Watching.
            Waiting.

            Unmoved. Unbothered.

            Because of course she planned for this.

            Other Lila’s Counterstrike.
            A single motion.
            That’s all it takes.

            Other Lila raises her hand, fingers flexing—and the sky ignites.

            A counterspell, vast and vicious, clawing at the very fabric of reality.

            The rift bomb?
            It stalls.

            And then—
            It reverses.

            Oh. Fuck.

            “Oh, you absolute bitch—” Abi snarls, hands flying across the console, trying to counter-counter-spell.

            Too late.
            The bomb turns inward.

            A pulse—
            A ripple—
            And the Fuckbunny lurches as reality flips.

            The Impossible Battlefield. The Fight Begins.
            The war doesn’t start.
            It detonates.

            The HMS Fuckbunny slams into the battlefield with a force that sends shockwaves across the island. The ground fractures, sending boulders and bodies alike hurling into the air.

            Lila is already moving—blade in hand, magic crackling in her veins.

            Cedric vaults the railing, landing in a brutal roll, already swinging his sword as a wave of dragonknights charge toward them.

            Seyrah?
            Already gone.
            A shadow in the chaos, knives finding throats.

            Aria?
            Guns hot, voice singing, her magic weaving through bullets as she takes to the sky.

            Oreth?
            Face grim, eyes glowing, twisting arcane equations mid-air, rewriting the very rules of the battlefield.

            Nereza?
            No words.
            Just violence.

            And above them all?

            Other Lila.
            Unmoved.
            Unbothered.

            A war queen on her throne, watching the chaos unfold—her lips curled in something like amusement.

            Because this?
            This isn’t a battle.

            This is a game.

            And she’s already won once before.

            And Now? The War Begins.
            What does Lila do next?

            HMS Fuckbunny crashes on Other Lila’s island as Lila, Aria Havensmith, and their crew engage in combat with dragonknights after a rift bomb and counter spell disrupt the battlefield.
