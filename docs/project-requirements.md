  - [x] Replace subsequent occurrences of `/^You said:/` with `</dungeon_master>\n<user>`  
  - [x] Replace all instances of `chatGPT said:` with `</user>\n<dungeon_master>`  
  - [x] Ensure file starts with `<user>` and ends with `</dungeon_master>`  
  - [x] Remove lines matching `/\d+\/\d+/` (with no other content)  
  - [x] Replace multiple newlines (`\n\n\n*`) with a single double newline (`\n\n`)  
  - [x] Verify all pattern matching is strictly case-insensitive and enforced

- **[x] Integrate File Upload & Processing**  
  - [x] Wire the file upload component to invoke transformation functions  
  - [x] Store the processed content in the Zustand store

---

### 5. Parsing and Rounds Generation

- **[x] Parse Processed Content into Rounds**  
  - [x] Identify rounds as pairs of `<user>` and `<dungeon_master>` nodes  
  - [x] For each round, extract and record:  
    - Round index  
    - Start line number  
    - End line number  
    - Total line count  
  - [x] Store round metadata (using file line number ranges) in the Zustand store

---

### 6. Chapter Chunking Module

- **[x] Implement Chapter Formation Logic**  
  - [x] Group rounds sequentially until the cumulative line count reaches or exceeds 2500  
  - [x] Ensure rounds remain in original order  
  - [x] Validate that the chapter has the minimum rounds required to meet the threshold  
  - [x] Store chapter metadata (with round ranges) in the Zustand store

---

### 7. Chapter Fine-Tuning UI & Actions

- **[x] Build Chapter Fine-Tuning View**  
  - [x] Create a table view for each chapter listing its rounds  
  - [x] Display round metadata: index, summary status icon, narrative summary (if available)  
  - [x] Add controls for each round:
    - **Slide Up:** Move chapter rounds above (including the invoked round) to the previous chapter (disabled on first chapter)  
    - **Slide Down:** Move chapter rounds below (including the invoked round) to the next chapter (disabled on last chapter)  
    - **Split:** Create a new chapter from the invoked round and all remaining rounds in chapter   
    - **Omit:** Mark the round as omitted (gray out row, flag in configuration, exclude from summarization)  
    - **Reroll:** Adjust the summarization queue (move to top if already queued or insert at the top)
  
- **[x] Integrate Fine-Tuning Controls with Store**  
  - [x] Ensure each control action updates the corresponding state in the Zustand store  
  - [x] Confirm all actions are reversible without confirmation dialogs
  - [x] Fix implementation of slide up/down and split functions to properly update state

  - [ ] Generate a JSON file using the schema:
    ```json
    {
      "chapters": [
        {
          "rounds": [start, end],
          "omit": [roundIndex, roundIndex, ...]
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Provide a "Download Chapter Configuration" button in the fine-tuning view

- **[ ] Implement Chapter Configuration Import**

---

### 11. Integration Testing & Bug Fixing

- **[ ] End-to-End Testing**  
  - [ ] Verify the file upload and processing flow (from raw file to transformed content)  
  - [ ] Test round parsing and chapter chunking accuracy  
  - [ ] Validate UI actions (Slide Up/Down, Split, Omit, Reroll) and their state updates  
  - [ ] Simulate round and chapter summarization flows, ensuring status icons and requeue behaviors work as intended  
  - [ ] Test configuration import/export functionality

- **[ ] Bug Fixing & Refinement**
